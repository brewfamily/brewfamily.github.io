The below map shows how to get between Guialmons and Santa Coloma de Queralt by foot/bike. Note that you can shorten the section between points A (Guialmons) and B (the church at Figuerola) by cutting directly through the wheat fields; if you choose to do so, be careful and stay out of the farmers' way (it's harvest season).
