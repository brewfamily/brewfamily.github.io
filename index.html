<h1 align='center'>Timeline (for extension week)</h1>

<p>To be determined (depending on who is staying longer, and what they want to do). Base will likely be SCQ, with excursions elsewhere. </p>


<h1 align='center'>Arrival</h1>
<p>Fly to Barcelona. Thereafter, where you go depends both on <em>when you arrive</em> and <em>where</em> you want to stay. Write if you need help making these decisions.  Otherwise, you're on your own.</p> -->



<h1 align='center'>Lodging</h1>


<h2>Barcelona (BCN)</h2>
<p>Depending on when you arrive/depart, and your preference for / aversion to cities, you may want to spend a night or more in Barcelona. Lodging is ample in Barcelona, but can be pricey. You can avoid spending lots of money by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bypassing Barcelona entirely by staying in SCQ any day before the 25th or after the 28th.
<li>Arranging with us (Joe/Coloma) to use our 2 bedroom apartment (already taken the night of the 24th, but otherwise available).
<li>Arranging with us (Joe/Coloma) to use friends' apartments.
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to do your own thing, you can get a hotel or AirBnB in Barcelona.</p>

<h2>Palamós</h2>

<p>Palamós is about 1 hour 20 minutes from Barcelona. It was the Brew family reunion site even before PML.</p>

<p>We are currently in the process of making decisions regarding lodging in Palamós.  We will likely lock down two large places with enough capacity to hold most (all?) of the attendees.  Hold off on reserving anything.</p>

<!-- <p>For simplicity's sake, everyone should make their own reservations for Palamós for at least the nights of the 25th and the 26th (and perhaps before, for early arrivers). Hotels are an option, but it'll be cheaper and more enjoyable to group together families and get house/apartments through AirBnB. You're on your own for this (unless you specifically write to Joe/Coloma to request help).</p>  

<p>Let's strive to all stay near each other. That means in the town of Palamós, as close as possible to the old sector (the bottom of the red area).</p> -->

<h2>Santa Coloma de Queralt (SCQ)</h2>

<p>SCQ is 1 hour from Barcelona / 2 hours from Palamós.</p>
<p>Given that this is a small town with no hotels and very few AirBnBs, we (Coloma/Joe) will arrange housing <em>unless you prefer to do so yourself</em>.</p>

<h1 align='center'>To-do list</h1>

<ul>
<li>Buy tickets
<li>Send ticket details (flight numbers, arrival dates/times) to Joe (he'll compile a list for everyone)
<li>If arriving on or before the 24th, decide on your pre-Palamós housing preferences. If you want to go to SCQ during that period, communicate this to Joe.
<li>If you want to use the BCN apartment, or use one of our friends' apartments, communicate this to Joe.
<li>Don't reserve lodging yet.  We will make decisions regarding group lodging around the end of January.
