We have two options for PML 2016:  

1. Palamós, a beach town on the "Costa Brava" north of Barcelona.  
2. Santa Coloma de Queralt, a small village in "Catalunya Profunda".  

We need to decide between these two options so as to move forward with arranging logistics (housing, food, activities, etc.).  

What follows is a quick overview of the advantages/disadvantages of each place.  At the bottom of the page is a poll in which you can state your preference. 


# Option 1: Palamós  

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMmKZC_Ohu4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Palamós is a beach town on the Costa Brava (2 hour drive from Barcelona).  It attracts visitors from all over Europe.  


**Main selling points**: Proximity to beach/water  

**Main downside**: Price and we don't have any local connections to arrange things  

**Activities**: Hang out at the beach, hike along coast, explore the town   

**Commentary**: The Costa Brava is obviously cool, as evidenced by the thousands of people who visit it every year. The idea here would be to get 1 or 2 large houses where we could do most of our hanging out, and then spend time during the day at the beach / in town.  The main thing that Palamós has that SCQ doesn't is the beach.


# Santa Coloma de Queralt

Santa Coloma is a small farming village (about 2,000 people) in rural Catalunya (1 hour drive from Barcelona).  

**Main selling point**: Non-touristy, local connections, price  

**Main downside**: No beach  

**Activities**: Hang out at the plaça (main square with lots of bars, restaurants and area to run around), hike, bike  

**Commentary**: SCQ is a very "authentic" Catalan village. As with Palamós, the idea here would be to get 1 to 2 large houses. The advantage of having "local" connections here is that we can do things like (a) have barbecues on Coloma's family's properties, (b) arrange with local restaurant/bar-owners to arrange special spaces/meals for us.  SCQ is about 1 hour from the beach, so a day trip would be easy.
