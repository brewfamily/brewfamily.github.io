The masses have spoken - and they want to spend most of their time between Santa Coloma de Queralt (SCQ) and the beach (probably Palam√≥s).  The tentative itinerary is to spend 3 nights at the beach (the nights of the 25, 26, and 27), followed by 2 nights in SCQ (the nights of the 28 and 29).  


But some have proposed spending more time at the beach and less time in SCQ.  Others have suggested that it would be better to spend more time in SCQ, and less at the beach.  


This questionnaire is meant to help us arrive at a consensus in regards to the beach/SCQ balance.
