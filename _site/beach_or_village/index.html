    <p>We have two options for PML 2016:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Palamós, a beach town on the &quot;Costa Brava&quot; north of Barcelona.<br></li>
<li>Santa Coloma de Queralt, a small village in &quot;Catalunya Profunda&quot;.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>We need to decide between these two options so as to move forward with arranging logistics (housing, food, activities, etc.).  </p>

<p>What follows is a quick overview of the advantages/disadvantages of each place.  At the bottom of the page is a poll in which you can state your preference. </p>

<h1>Option 1: Palamós</h1>

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMmKZC_Ohu4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Palamós is a beach town on the Costa Brava (2 hour drive from Barcelona).  It attracts visitors from all over Europe.  </p>

<p><strong>Main selling points</strong>: Proximity to beach/water  </p>

<p><strong>Main downside</strong>: Price and we don&#39;t have any local connections to arrange things  </p>

<p><strong>Activities</strong>: Hang out at the beach, hike along coast, explore the town   </p>

<p><strong>Housing</strong>: Fancy villas (like <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1870487">https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1870487</a> and <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1707401">https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1707401</a>) and hotels or rental apartments in town.  </p>

<p><strong>Commentary</strong>: The Costa Brava is obviously cool, as evidenced by the thousands of people who visit it every year. The idea here would be to get 1 or 2 large houses where we could do most of our hanging out, and then spend time during the day at the beach / in town.  The main thing that Palamós has that SCQ doesn&#39;t is the beach.  </p>

<p>If we decide to go the Palamós route, Joe and Coloma will likely take a trip next week to explore housing options.  </p>

<h1>Santa Coloma de Queralt</h1>

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJH8QmRE1z4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Santa Coloma is a small farming village (about 2,000 people) in rural Catalunya (1 hour drive from Barcelona).  </p>

<p><strong>Main selling point</strong>: Non-touristy, local connections, price<br>
<strong>Main downside</strong>: No beach  </p>

<p><strong>Activities</strong>: Hang out at the plaça (main square with lots of bars, restaurants and area to run around), hike, bike   </p>

<p><strong>Housing</strong>: Fancy &quot;casa rurals&quot; (like <a href="http://www.cangasol.net/">http://www.cangasol.net/</a> and <a href="http://www.calpadro.net/">http://www.calpadro.net/</a>) and with family (for those that want a no/low-cost option).</p>

<p><strong>Commentary</strong>: SCQ is a very &quot;authentic&quot; Catalan village. As with Palamós, the idea here would be to get 1 to 2 large houses. The advantage of having &quot;local&quot; connections here is that we can do things like (a) have barbecues on Coloma&#39;s family&#39;s properties, (b) arrange with local restaurant/bar-owners to arrange special spaces/meals for us.  SCQ is about 1 hour from the beach, so a day trip would be easy.  </p>

<p>If we decide to go the SCQ route, Joe and Coloma can arrange housing/meals/activities easily (since Coloma knows everyone in town).  </p>

<h1>Poll</h1>

<p>This questionnaire is meant to help us decide whether to spend our time based at the beach (Palmós / Costa Brava) or in a village (Santa Coloma de Queralt).</p>
