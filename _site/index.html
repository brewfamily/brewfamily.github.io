<h1 align='center'>Lodging</h1>


<h2>Santa Coloma de Queralt (SCQ)</h2>

<p>We have arranged all housing for the reunion week (plus the extension week, for those who want to stick around). In other words, you're taken care of from July 23rd through August 6th. SCQ is 1 hour from Barcelona. Coloma and Joe are arranging all housing.</p>

<h2>Barcelona (BCN)</h2>
<p>Depending on when you arrive/depart, and your preference for / aversion to cities, you may want to spend a night or more in Barcelona. Lodging is ample in Barcelona, but can be pricey. You can avoid spending lots of money by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bypassing Barcelona entirely by staying in SCQ.
<li>Arranging with us (Joe/Coloma) to use our 2 bedroom apartment (already taken the night of the 24th, but otherwise available).
<li>Arranging with us (Joe/Coloma) to use friends' apartments.
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to do your own thing, you can get a hotel or AirBnB in Barcelona.</p>

<h1 align='center'>To-do list</h1>

<ul>
<li>Buy tickets
<li>Send ticket details (flight numbers, arrival dates/times) to Joe (he'll compile a list for everyone)
<li>If arriving on or before the 23rd, decide on your pre-SCQ housing preferences. If you want to go to SCQ during that period, communicate this to Joe.
<li>If you want to use the BCN apartment, or use one of our friends' apartments, communicate this to Joe.
<li>Considering reserving lodging for the period before or after the reunion, or coordinating with Joe about this if you'd like help.
